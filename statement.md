--------------PROJECT STATEMENT---------------
TOPIC: RESTAURANT BILLING SYSTEM 

#PROBLEM STATEMENT:
~ Small restaurants and cafe counters often face difficulties in handling billing efficiently using manual methods.Manula billing can lead to calculation errors, time delays , difficulty applying discounts, adn inconsistent customer experience.
There is a need for a simple , accurate , and user - friendly software system that can automate the ordering and billing process , ensuring fast service, transparency , and error-free calculations.

#SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
-> The project focuses on building a Python-based Restaurant Billing System that:

-->Displays a predefined menu with item prices

-->Allows customers to select multiple items with quantities

-->Validates user inputs to prevent mistakes

-->Calculates the total bill with discount options

-->Generates a clean and itemized bill summary

-->Provides a smooth ordering and checkout flow


The project is restricted to a CLI (Command Line Interface) application and does not involve databases or GUIs at this stage. Future enhancements may expand these features.

#Target Users

This system is designed for:

-->Small restaurant/café staff who need a quick billing tool

-->Cashiers who want an organized workflow for taking orders

-->Students / beginners practicing modular Python programming

-->Project evaluators assessing functional software design


The interface is simple enough for non-technical users while demonstrating structured programming practices for academic assessment.
